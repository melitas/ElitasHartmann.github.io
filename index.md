# Elitas Hartmann Lab
### Single-Cell Microengineering of Stress and Adaptation

We engineer microfluidic and bioelectronic platforms to quantify how single cells respond to stress in disease and infection.

---

## Research Programs

### Antibiotic Resistance & Bacterial Persistence
Microfluidic microecologies and single-cell assays to quantify tolerance and survival under antibiotic stress.

### Cancer–Immune Microenvironments
Microengineered platforms to study tumor–immune communication, migration, and phenotypic heterogeneity.

### Stress-Based Biosensors & Diagnostics
Portable biosensing and nucleic-acid testing systems for resource-limited and field settings.
