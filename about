## About the Elitas Hartmann Lab

The Elitas Hartmann Lab focuses on understanding how single cells adapt to stress in biological systems relevant to infection and cancer.

We engineer microfluidic and bioelectronic platforms to quantify cellular responses to chemical, physical, and biological stressors at the single-cell level.

Our work bridges engineering and life sciences to uncover mechanistic principles of cellular heterogeneity and adaptation that are critical for therapeutic response and diagnostics.
