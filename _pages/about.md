## About the Elitas Lab

The SHIELD Lab focuses on understanding how single cells adapt to stress in biological systems relevant to infection and cancer.

We develop microfluidic and bioelectronic platforms to quantitatively measure cellular responses to chemical, physical, and biological stressors at the single-cell level.

Our work bridges engineering and life sciences, with the goal of uncovering mechanistic principles of cellular heterogeneity and adaptation that are critical for therapeutic response and diagnostics.
